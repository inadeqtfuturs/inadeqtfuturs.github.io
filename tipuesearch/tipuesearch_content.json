My director suggested the book last summer somewhere between me reading A Thousand Plateaus and Claire Colebrook\u2019s Death of the PostHuman as an example of a negative version of Deleuze that might help make sense of Colebrook\u2019s work. In general, and this is the way I\u2019ve always read D&G, TP has always been this joyous and affirmative text riddled with \u2018little monsters\u2019 for cultivating novel concepts (Culp 1). Each plateau offered something new\u2014a new concept, methodology, reading. In moments of lucidity (usually while reading and then never again) it feels very portable. Dark Deleuze, by comparison, is very different: \u2018Emerging from scholars concerned with the condition of the present, the darkness refashions a revolutionary Deleuze: revolutionary negativity in a world characterized by compulsory happiness, decentralized control, and overexposure\u2019 (2). This struck me as odd for two reasons: first, all of my work is \u2018concerned with the condition of the present,\u2019 so it seemed odd that I hadn\u2019t encountered much of this scholarship. But second, and while I absolutely agree with Culp that the revolutionary concepts offered by Deleuze throughout his corpus\u2014\u2018transversal lines, rhizomatic connections, compositionist networks, complex assemblages, affective experiences, and enchanted objects\u2019\u2014had been largely integrated into public consciousness, it\u2019s never occurred to me Deleuze\u2019s work had run it\u2019s course, cleaved into neoliberal-ese (7). There\u2019s a lot to like in Culp\u2019s book, and I don\u2019t want to run through a bunch of the stuff I disagree with. Rather, I want to try to articulate why the negativity deployed throughout Dark Deleuze , in contradistinction to the \u2018joyous cannon Deleuze\u2019 I tend to think about and use, doesn\u2019t seem to break out of the critique negativity mounts against contemporary theory. Recent theory turns to negativity to hold positive, productive, and affirmative accounts of subject formation and new materialism, for example, complicit in capitalist practices. Negativity points at its antipode and says, \u2018You\u2019re colluding with the enemy; we need to destroy it and, by proxy, you.\u2019 My answer to this accusation has been a resigned shrug, agreement, and \u2018but,\u2019 for about a year now. Re-reading Culp\u2019s book, I\u2019m beginning to figure out why. If theory\u2019s main purpose is to offer tools or frameworks for navigating and changing the world (a big \u2018if\u2019), then it\u2019s unclear to me what negativity\u2019s goal oriented critique offers. This may be an unfair characterization: negativity is about praxis and method over and above the final outcome. However, negativity\u2019s claim that productivity and positivity cannot lead to the end of the world intertwines ends and means. One of the main things Culp\u2019s book is trying to cultivate is what he calls \u2018Hatred for This World;\u2019 a call to arms for \u2018the Death of this World.\u2019 Culp argues, \u2018My ultimate purpose is to convince readers to completely abandon all the joyous paths for their dark alternatives. The best scenario would be that these contraries fade into irrelevance after Dark Deleuze achieves its ostensible goal: the end of this world, the final defeat of the state, and full communism\u2019 (20). \u2018World\u2019 comes to the fore as a stand in for neoliberal globalism and its counterpart, liberal democracy. While these interwoven structures remain, full communism remains an impossibility and we remain the exploited working class. But I don\u2019t entirely see how this goal differs from other liberatory political and ethical thinking, especially that deployed in posthumanism (broadly) or new materialism (specifically) [1]; part of it seems ontological rather than political. Framed that way, I, too, want to bring the world to an end. Where Dark Deleuze and I diverge is less in where we end up than how we get there, and DD will continue to remind me not only that the affirmative path has not worked, but that it\u2019s already been compromised. It\u2019s in the section on \u2018un-becoming\u2019 that it feels like light and dark slide back into one another. Readers of Deleuze know becoming is not a wholly liberatory practice; rather, it reminds us that subjectivity and embodiment are ongoing negotiations between bodies and with(in) environments, not stable positions. In this way, to become, to inhabit territory otherwise, is also to deterritorialize\u2014it\u2019s always a double gesture. Culp allows this, noting \u2018Becoming is really a process of un-becoming,\u2019 and offers assemblage as the light Deleuze\u2019s inferior mode of subjectivity: \u2018assemblage-modeling is a perfect fit in a world where capitalism produces subjectivity\u2019 (26, 27). I completely agree with this description, but if assemblages are the (theoretical and ontological) apparatuses through which subjectivity is constituted, it doesn\u2019t seem enough to simply switch conceptual frameworks. Part of the argument seems to be that assemblages are merely the way capitalism theorizes subjectivity, either because it\u2019s consumed the once radical framework or because assemblages describe the state of things. Subjects could think in terms of un-becoming to get out of this, it\u2019s unclear if shifting theoretical terrain is as liberatory a practice as this section makes it out to be. Ultimately, the methodology offered here doesn\u2019t seem light or dark, but just Deleuzian. What I both admire and need more time with is the speed and intensity at which Dark Deleuze operates. On the one hand, I want to take the book to task for miscalculating the necessary double gesture of political and theoretical work, which imbricates all resistance within existing forms of power. DD \u2019s solutions feel accelerationist inasmuch as it prescribes breaking through current systems of power rather than working within them [2]. It\u2019s one thing to offer a methodology of working with in the neoliberal apparatuses identified as oppressive in order to replace them later with assemblages, but I don\u2019t know how sharp these concepts cut. Foucault\u2019s \u2018A Preface to Transgression\u2019 comes to mind here: transgression or inverse power doesn\u2019t work because it merely shifts the threshold of transgression. We need transversal lines of attack. On the other hand, maybe this is precisely what Dark Deleuze is offering, but it\u2019s not entirely clear. Culp adds, \u2018the force of thought is  matter of style and not the specification of concepts.\u2019 Style and force over content; speed over complexity. Maybe. Dark Deleuze is an intensely useful text, and there\u2019s much about it that I like and agree with. If you believer yourself to be a thinker of affirmation, this \u2018little monster\u2019 might pull you into a different mode of thought less antithetical than interrogatory to your own. A longer reading, perhaps, would make me slide into the dark Deleuze camp. // Notes: 1. Culp argues, \u2018A superior materialism \u201cconstructs a real that is yet to come\u201d (TP, 142). It does not follow so-called new materialism, which is really just a new form of animism, but Marxist materialism as the revolutionary subversion of material necessity\u2019 (31). 2.

My dissertation is titled inadequate futures and positions posthumanism as a viable mode of intra-acting for sustainable futures in a moment of economic, ecological, and social precarity and catastrophe. Like much work about the nonhuman turn and the anthropocene, inadequate futures foregrounds a future devoid of the human, but rather than subsiding into existential dread or proffering ways of sustaining humanity, suggests reconfiguring subjectivity and ethics on new materialist and vitalist grounds in order to sustain something like an impersonal life, or a life more generally. Indeed, humanity will become extinct, but that doesn\u2019t mean that who/what we understand as human doesn\u2019t have radical ethical commitment to the environment or one another as we march towards demise.

It\u2019s clear to me how posthumanism as a discourses arises in the latter half of the 20th century: globalization, transnationalism, and the onset of network culture force us to think differently about how humans are connected. The cellphone (and really, the smartphone) shifts attention away from the human body to the human with(in) a network. The smartphone has become a very literal and felt extension of one kind of cyborg subjectivity. In this way, it\u2019s like what Nathan Jurgenson says about identity performance: \u2018Social media surely change identity performance. For one, it makes the process more explicit\u2019 (\u2019 The Disconnectionists \u2019). Our imbrication in technology makes explicit something we might have missed before\u2014how the human and tool are woven together into assemblages or amalgams\u2014but that then seems ontologically grounded. Theories of performativity and discipline get to swerve around this issue to an extent because they\u2019re interested (genealogically) in very specific moments and modes of subjectivity. And I\u2019m trying to make a similar kind of periodizing argument about the inadequacy of the liberal human as a model for understanding subjectivity in the 21st century (low hanging fruit to be sure). But to what extent do these arguments about intra-activity extend beyond this specific historical, social, and cultural moment? In Barad, at least back to when Bohr was working through his theory of quantum physics, but what about further back? And what are the consequences for reading this theoretical framework backwards? At stake here is a kind of recognition of our mutual contingency with(in) (non)human subjects. I\u2019m trying to foreground how liberal humanism and fantasies of unified bodies inhibit our ability to recognize our fragmentary being. Unless we\u2019re able to confront our intra-active becoming and affirm the reality of our situation\u2014not just of subjectivity, but the crises that surround and produce our subjectivity\u2014there cannot be a future in which the human remains. Perhaps the division between subjectivity and discourse is enough, But I still feel the anxiety of making an ontological argument, knowing how contingent these kind of descriptions are. I\u2019m trying to embrace the ephemerality and contingency of these kind of frameworks, especially since maintaining the transcendence of any theory seems exceedingly humanistic and hubristic.

Danielewski\u2019s work, a novelist who\u2019s been with me since I first thought about teaching, and latter became an important fixture for how I think about literature, and then, again, latter, became an even more important figure for how I think about ethics, (non)humans, and so much more. Although the chapter is specifically interested in inter-weaving Danielewski\u2019s most recent set of novels, collectively known as The Familiar , into contemporary posthumanism, figuring The Familiar as another resource for theorizing relationality among (non)humans, it\u2019s also given me a chance to revisit his work as a whole. Specifically, I\u2019m looking at some of the \u2018paratextual\u2019 (if you can call it that) projects surrounding The Familiar including a talk that later became an article called \u2018Parable No. 9: The Hopeless Animal and the End of Nature.\u2019 Given in Cologne, Germany in the Fall of 2010, the talk catalyzed my interest in posthumanism, actor network theory, and speculative realism (though I\u2019ve largely abandoned the latter two in favor of the former), and continues to inform how I think about hope and our relation to animals. By that same token, I\u2019m hoping that \u2018Parable No. 9\u2019 will offer insight into Danielewski\u2019s novels\u2014there\u2019s clearly cross-contamination\u2014as well as provide fodder for positioning his work among other posthuman theorists. Any chance to revisit Danielewski\u2019s work, to my mind, is also an invitation to re-read House of Leaves , which I first read as a senior in high school and greatly influenced my expectation about fiction and what novels could do. I still have the same copy I read nearly a decade ago. It still has pencil and pen marks from years of annotating. It\u2019s now signed, though it remains wine-stained and its pages are prone to falling out. It is a strange object, and it holds more significance than I can articulate here. However, I want to briefly think about how House of Leaves conditioned my expectations for novels as inhuman forces rather as somehow familiar compatriots or friends. That is, the novel has never (just) been a site for depicting the intense personal experience of characters, but always a force for modulating the subjectivity of readers; not a site for reflection, but for the production of difference. That is, I\u2019ve always understood the novel primarily in terms of it\u2019s material affective force, not unlike how new materialism would understand it. In the opening chapter of her Vibrant Matter , Jane Bennett describes debris found in a storm drain in Baltimore: \u2018Glove, pollen, rat, cap, stick. As I encountered these items, they shimmied back and forth between debris and thing\u2014between, on the one hand, stuff to ignore, except insofar as it betokened human activity (the workman\u2019s efforts, the litterer\u2019s toss, the rat-poisoner\u2019s success), and, on the other hand, stuff that commanded attention in its own right\u2019 (4). This distinction between debris and thing inaugurates an intense discussion and rearticulation of a political ecology that cannot merely include anthropocentric notions of nonhuman stuff. Instead, matter itself comes to matter in terms of what it does within the polis\u2014rerouting attention, causing power outages, or (dis)allowing crops to grow. Matter is a force that affects the humans who encounter it, dispersing agency from the unified and autonomous body of the liberal human subject. House of Leaves \u2019s protagonist and major textual contributor, Johnny Truant, offers this description of Zampa\u00f1o\u2019s room: \u2018\u2026and for some odd reason\u2014what I remember most of all\u2014a very old tube of chapstick with an amber like resin, hard & cracked. Which still isn\u2019t entirely accurate; though don\u2019t be misled into thinking I\u2019m not trying to be accurate. There were, I admit, other things I recall about this place, they just don\u2019t seem relevant now. To my eye, it was all just junk, time having performed no economic alchemy there, which hardly mattered\u2019 ( H OL xvi). Here, Johnny sees junk akin to Bennett\u2019s debris, but what he finds later is that the junk is actually a bunch of \u2018things\u2019 that are important in their own right. One could read the ephemera that Johnny finds as anthropocentric traces of a previous life, markers of both Zampa\u00f1o and the Navidson\u2019s narrative that must be retraced, linearized, and narrativized. However, the novel resists this reading at every turn, insisting on the affective properties this \u2018junk.\u2019 Johnny\u2019s warped physical and psychological state are less indicative of something associated with the narrative he\u2019s piecing together, than a very literal and physical haunting produced by the sheer affective force of the ephemera he\u2019s dealing with and the process of tracking everything down. What Johnny finds in reading and editing The Navidson Record is not some (new) way to be human\u2014some recognizable \u2018self\u2019 that tells him how (not) to be\u2014nor another subjectivity to relate to. Instead, he finds the inhuman force of narrative, which produces fear, loneliness, and obsession. Repeated scenes of excessive ephemera highlight the sheer weight of text he edits, stretching Johnny is disparate directions and resisting unification. During a panic attack at the tattoo parlor, when he believes he\u2019s being attacked by some monstrous force, he describes, \u2018Words filling my head. Fragments like artillery shells. Shrapnel, like syllables, flying everywhere. Terrible syllables. Sharp. Cracked. Traveling at murderous speed\u2019 (71). Language does not mean here, and it doesn\u2019t seem to primarily mean anywhere in the novel, but cuts, wounds, and affects. Language is not primarily semiotic mediator of narrative, but perhaps material and affective. House of Leaves \u2019s epigraph offers a warning: \u2018This is not for you.\u2019 That is, you will not find yourself in here, but what you will find is yourself undergoing a series of changes in light of this iterative intra-action. You will be confronted with something monstrous and inhuman; something language cannot pin it down; something that exceeds humanist and linguistic grasp. I think of Johnny, with his ephemera as the model reader, twisted by the very materiality of the text that we hold. Our postures, our re-orientations of the novel, our affective plight all echo Johnny\u2019s relationship with The Navidson Record . Johnny shows us the inhuman we become in our intra-action with literature. This is a preliminary idea that I hope the chapter refines, but I think the idea is something like this: reading is a becoming, but I think it\u2019s an un-becoming of ourselves\u2014a destabilization rather than a shoring up. Literature confronts us with inhuman forces that reshape our subjectivity\u2014forces felt most explicitly in poetry but surely imbricated in all writing. The question I understand Danielewski\u2019s novels to open is what do we do with this inhuman force? What does this unmaking do to us? This chapter will turn to the productive potential opened by this inhuman confrontation and our individual and collective unmaking.", "title": "[008 - the novel as inhuman] - inadequate futures"}, {"loc": "/post/002-barad-fine-details/", "tags": "nonetags", "text": "Rereading Karen Barad\u2019s Meeting the Universe Halfway is a refreshing reminder of everything I find useful in new materialism and posthumanism. Concerned primarily with how quantum physics might reshape the way we think about matter, agency, and ethics, Barad\u2019s work if helpful for articulating where ethical commitments beyond the human, or the human-to-human, might reside. Her reworking of agency is particularly important for her interweaving of the philosophy of physics and poststructural, as she repeats throughout. For Barad, agency is not something humans have, or even particular bodies possess, but rather a distributed enactment across an intra-active assemblage (my word) or apparatus. She argues, \u2018Agency is \u201cdoing\u201d or \u201cbeing\u201d in its intra-activity. It is the enactment of iterative changes of particular practices\u2014iterative reconfigurings of topological manifolds of spacetimematter relations\u2014through the dynamics of intra-activity. Agency is about changing possibilities of change entailed in reconfiguring material-discursive apparatuses of bodily production\u2019 (178). This emphasis on intra-activity reminds us that we (and let\u2019s leave this as a slippery signifier) are involved in agency with other matters we tend to not consider imbricated in ourselves. Matter comes to matter through \u2018iterative reconfigurings;\u2019 states that both continually change but also remain the same\u2014cells perpetually dying and being replaced in bodies human and otherwise, for example. Agency is less a deployment of force here than the tipping over of a system into something else or towards a different state\u2014a storm tipping over from rain and thunder into a tornado and back again. In a more anthropocentric mode, it\u2019s also about admitting that who and what we are is heavily influenced and perhaps even dependent on the matter that surrounds us, both discursive but also (new) material. It\u2019s here that I see Barad linking up rather explicitly with poststructuralism, as if to intensify the performative and disciplinary sutures provided by Butler and Foucault. If Butler and Foucault teach us that power circulates by and through bodies both docile and disciplined, that iterative performances produce the conditions for socially (un)meaningful practices, Barad shows us reality itself, not merely human discourse, might be performative all the way down. While \u2018reality\u2019 or \u2018realism\u2019 tends to be cringe inducing in poststructuralist circles where it\u2019s often treated as a retrenchment in structuralism and the liberal humanist subject who mediates reality, Barad\u2019s \u2018agential realism\u2019 repositions humans not as transcendent mediator but as interwoven into the iterative reproduction of reality. Barad seeks to reformulate realism \u2018in terms of the goal of providing accurate descriptions of that reality of which we are a part and with which we intra-act, rather than some imagined and idealized human-independent reality\u2019 (207). The problem of objectivity and mediation lies at the heart of Barad\u2019s goal: how do we disentangle the human from reality if it\u2019s the only subjectivity we inhabit? But Barad suggests, \u2018 Objectivity means being accountable for marks on bodies, that is, specific materializations in their differential mattering . We are responsible for the cuts that we help enact not because we do the choosing (neither do we escape responsibility because \u201cwe\u201d are \u201cchosen\u201d by them), but because we are an agential part of the material becoming of the universe\u2019 (178). This language resonates with Haraway\u2019s work on cyborgs and companion species, but it\u2019s also clearly reminiscent of Butler and Levinas, specifically the idea of having to account for the self. Levinas reminds us, \u2018The responsibility for the other can not have begun in my commitment, in my decision. The unlimited responsibility in which I find myself comes from the hither side of my freedom, from a \u201cprior to every memory,\u201d an \u201culterior to every accomplishment,\u201d from the non-present par excellence, the non-original, the anarchical, prior to or beyond essence\u2019 ( Otherwise Than Being 10). We do not choose responsibility nor what we respond to; rather, response is figured as the passive ground for subjectivity. Although I cannot account for myself because what constitutes my subjectivity (my environment, language, and others) precedes me, all relationships bear a \u2018trace\u2019 of our responsibility to the other ( OtB 12). Levinas\u2019s trace is excessively human and his ethical encounters primarily circulate around the face-to-face encounter of two human subjects. But Barad opens the possibility of a different kind of accountability and the necessity of the passive grounds of our own materiality, and by extension, responsibility. Levinas argues that subjectivity is bound up in the trace of those who have come before us, and that we are bound up in those that come after us. We necessarily respond to the presence of their absence by virtue of being embodied in a specific cultural-historical-social milieu neither chosen nor consented to. For Butler, this becomes the cite of giving an account of the self. Because I arrive late, exposed to a world I have not chosen and cannot account for, \u2018The \u201cI\u201d cannot give a final or adequate account of itself because it cannot return to the scene of address by which it is inaugurated and it cannot narrate all of the rhetorical dimensions of the structure of address in which the account itself takes place\u2019 ( Giving an Account of One\u2019s Self 67). I see Barad participating in a similar argument, though perhaps with further reaching consequences because her work is less indebted to or even interested in the human. While reality in Butler is primarily social and discursive reality, Barad seeks reality beyond the human-to-human encounters described above. In Barad, and this holds true in poststructuralism and critical theory more generally, reality is never what it seems\u2014it\u2019s constantly more complicated than we give it credit for largely because the apparatuses, discourses, and methodologies by which we understand and (re)articulate reality shape the way we understand it. This is entirely Barad\u2019s point and intervention by way of Bohr, and it\u2019s surely something poststructuralism taught us in the 1970\u2019s, but Barad\u2019s work foregrounds the complexity and labor involved in articulating a thick description of reality. In the chapter on diffractive reading\u2014a reading practice attuned to the subjects intra-active participation in the act of reading that emphasizes difference, as opposed to a reflective reading that would subject/object divide and the sameness in the act of reading (the subject and object as static) [1]\u2014the phrase \u2018fine detail\u2019 comes up twice in quick succession as a stand-in for what\u2019s often left aside or bracketed in our descriptions of reality. I think Barad\u2019s realism ends up being what we might productive call a \u2018hyperrealism;\u2019 not in the Baudrillardian sense, but in the representational sense that hyperreality painting is interested in. Hyperrealism is wary of the human eye\u2019s ability to perceive reality and is attentive to what human vision leaves out, brackets, or isn\u2019t sharp enough to pick up on. By emphasizing the complexity of reality, the intra-active (re) and (co)production of reality, Barad tunes us into the intricacies of everyday life. This isn\u2019t just zooming in and out or seeing from a different point of view, but recognizing the way that reality is mediated in and through the (non)discursive apparatuses we find ourselves imbricated in. This is extremely useful for me since I see posthumanism less as a wholesale reconfiguration of the human, than an intensified attention to how the human intra-acts with(in) the networks it (co)inhabits. I would tentatively conclude by suggesting that posthumanism as a hyperrealism forces us out of an anthropocentric mode and multiplies our attention the intra-active forces that (co)produce reality. Our multitudinous experiences are surely laborious, but they also matter a great deal. As Barad notes, \u2018The being of the world is a deeply ethical matter\u2019 (185). //Notes 1. To be fair, while I find Barad\u2019s description of diffractive reading helpful and interesting, I do think that much theory that identifies as \u2018reflexive\u2019 is already doing some of this kind of thinking.

Our narrator, who we later learn is a corporate cultural anthropologist named \u2018U.\u2019, describes the shroud of Turin, which only came into focus \u2018when some amateur photographer looked at the negative of a shot he\u2019d taken of the thing, and saw the figure\u2014pale and faded, but there nonetheless. Only in the negative: the negative became a positive, which means that the shroud itself was, in effect, a negative already\u2019 (3). Right: the dialectical play of signifiers where the maligned or background element is elevated or brought into the foreground. You know immediately, if you\u2019re unfamiliar with McCarthy\u2019s work, that you\u2019re in a novel heavily mediated by critical theory. U. considers himself a new Levi-Strauss, a figure who comes up repeatedly throughout, an aspirational figure for U.\u2019s work compiling dossiers for the Company to advise other companies on (re)branding, paradigm shifting, and general business speak. However, U. has surpassed Levi-Strauss by the time we meet him, having written a semi-famous ethnographic account of the New York club culture. His work foregrounds the collapse of field and home, work and life, noting, \u2018when the object of your study is completely interwoven with your own life and its rhythms, this distinction vanishes: Where (I asked, repeatedly) does home end and field begin\u2026Does sex with a Lycra-miniskirted informant on your writing table at five a.m. when you\u2019re both tripping count?\u2019 (25). Postmodernism teaches us this lesson well, and it bears repeating, but it\u2019s the novel\u2019s insistence of this indistinction and continual rendering of where we experience indistinctions within \u2018the contemporary\u2019 where the novel seems most relevant and \u2018malign[able].\u2019 More than anything, Satin Island is the culmination of thick descriptive practices offered by both postmodernism and poststructuralism (and its heirs), but in the key of the contemporary. On the theoretical front, the novel suggests that postmodernism has been surpassed and wholly integrating it into neoliberal sphere. U. describes his job as \u2018feeding vanguard theory [Levi-Strauss, Deleuze, Badiou], almost always from the left side of the spectrum, back into the corporate machine. The machine could swallow everything, incorporate it seamlessly, like a giant loom that reweaves all fabric, no matter how recalcitrant and jarring its raw form, into what my hero would have called a master-pattern\u2014or, if not that, then maybe just the pattern of the master\u2019 (33). Two contradictory things appear to happen here: on the one hand, theory is rendered impotent in the face of contemporary capitalism since it can be woven into the master-narrative that circumscribes the globe. On the other hand, the novel resists meta-narratives wholesale. U.\u2019s pet project, \u2018The Great Report,\u2019 a unified dossier of everything, is always discussed as an impossibility\u2014a narrative that cannot and will no cohere. U. continuously confronts the difficulty of giving it form: \u2018What fluid morphing hybrid could I come up with to be equal to the task? What medium, or media, would it inhabit? Would it tell a story? If so, how, and about what, or whom? If not, how would it all congeal, around what cohere?\u2019 (78). Despite multiple attempts, the project never reaches fruition. This tension between the (im)possibility of meta-narratives makes Satin Island both post-postmodern and perhaps not postmodern enough, with capitalism being the only remaining metanarrative, continuing to \u2018swallow everything.\u2019 The contemporary becomes a threshold through which well-worn forms are always already inadequate, but novelty remains just out of reach. Satin Island surely depicts contemporary lived experience beyond the academic thought experiments U. finds himself working through. The tedium of surveillance culture, the ubiquity of natural disasters, and a news cycle predicated on spectacle all make an appearance, helping to map the dizziness of ubiquitous information. The mysterious death of a parachuter runs throughout the novel, catching U.\u2019s eye early in the novel but fading out of the news cycle as the trail of clues related to what\u2019s deemed a homicide runs dry. U., however, thinks he\u2019s solved it, creating a bulletin board and dossier of clues: the parachuters were playing a game of Russian Roulette, \u2018I was certain of this\u2026The triangles, the lines and vectors all made sense now: it seemed to me, in that instant, that I\u2019d solved not just a private puzzle but a fundamental riddle of our time\u2019 (129). Everything becomes a fractal, fitting into a larger and comprehensive whole, even as the novel reminds us that the whole cannot hold. U.\u2019s theory ends up being a warning against this process by which everything can be fit into a unified whole. When U. thinks \u2018I saw the truth behind the parachutist case,\u2019 the novel is warning against any kind of \u2018truth\u2019 residing beneath or behind what\u2019s presented (128, my emphasis). That is, the contemporary straddles the line between singularity and part of a larger whole. The novel, in both form and content, performs this tension, but doesn\u2019t offer much of a way through, just more description. While reading, I thought of Don DeLillo\u2019s Mao II (1991), a very different mapping of a very different era, but both texts go to pains to ask \u2018what is the major cultural force in circulation globally?\u2019 Whereas Mao II suggests the terrorist has replaced the novelist as the major cultural creative force [1], Satin Island shows how the contemporary is haunted by a far more insidious presence. U.\u2019s lover tells him, \u2018You want to be the hero in the film who runs away in slo-mo from the villains factory that he\u2019s just mined, throwing himself to the ground as it explodes. But the explosion\u2019s taking place already\u2014it\u2019s always been taking place. You just didn\u2019t notice\u2019 (140). Of course, the very entropy the destroys the system is what is integrated back into it, much like the vanguard theory U. replenishes the Company with. The system itself, neoliberalism and globalism, are the main forces that move things. It\u2019s here that I begin understanding why the novel was maligned by many at \u2018The Contemporary\u2019 conference. It\u2019s such a good description of contemporary lived experience that it feels on the nose, as if everything U. tells us is something that I already knew but needed verification. But this experience makes me think that we\u2019re heading towards the now-ness that U. describes. These reminders of the indistinction between life and field, cause and effect, part and whole, the collapsing of these binaries, helps foreground the state of \u2018the contemporary\u2019 not as something to rally against but take as a new framework\u2014endless and self-perpetuating. I\u2019m avoiding much of the plot, but one moment to end on that\u2019s important my project is the force guarantees the continuity of the world U. inhabits. In a moment of lucidity, he notes, \u2018It strikes me that our entire social organism\u2013it\u2019s economy, it\u2019s social policy, its civil order\u2013that these don\u2019t implode, hurling us all into a wild abyss of plunder, rape and burning, is down to their being reined in, held in alignment, by a yoking to this notion of the Future\u2019 (91). So perhaps it\u2019s not entropy or theory that neoliberalism, globalism, and capitalism feast on, but the imaginary future that allows the present to maintain standard operating practices. As U. is noting here, without the phantasmic future just out of our reach, the present would cease to hold. In this way, we might situate Satin Island\u2019s on-the-nose-ness as part of re(con)figuring the present in order to continue imagining a future, the very thing that keeps the present churning forward. While efforts to rethink the contemporary, U.\u2019s Present-Tense Anthropology TM , are met with confusion or derision, the novel\u2019s descriptions of contemporary lived experience, simultaneously (counter)intuitive, offer one mapping that might trouble S.O.P., jamming the Company\u2019s machinery and offering a space to (re)work the present and future. //Notes 1. \u2018Who do we take seriously?

As Trump pulls the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Accord (indeed, a largely symbolic act but with very real ecological, economic, and political ramifications), I\u2019m struck by the right\u2019s oxymoronic stance on the country\u2019s autonomy, or the ability to be autonomous in an age of intensified globalization. It\u2019s easy to see the tension between the way the nation-state holds open the door for transnational capital\u2014i.e. producing fluid borders rather than locking them down and securing the reproduction of a specific citizenry\u2014and the insistence that somehow the U.S. can stand alone, or dictate the terms by which its borders function. The travel ban, increased racist violence, and the dream of an economy sustained by coal all play into this fantasy of the autonomous nation, and by proxy the autonomous masculine figurehead Trump longs to become. I don\u2019t want to repeat the obvious: climate change is a problem that resides simultaneously in the present and future (but also the past since we\u2019re probably 30 years too late to do anything about it); autonomy is a fantasy ontologically, and an impossibility economically. Autonomy is less about locking down the self or the nation, than dictating the terms by which these bodies are porous or vulnerable. It\u2019s a chauvinist and masculinist deployment of power that seeks to impose the will of the self onto the world it inhabits. It\u2019s a way of saying, \u2018I am not vulnerable to what lies beyond me, but rather will make what remains beyond my control subservient to me; to my world view. I will shape the world in my image, and thereby refuse my own vulnerability.\u2019 Again, entirely an impossibility in our contemporary moment. On the side of ice shelves falling off the antarctic, I find myself working on a presentation of Barad and Levinas (which seeks to rethink our capacity to intra-act with reality to co-produce a slightly different future) and reading Spahr\u2019s collection. That Winter the Wolf Came has been less a solution than an antipode and coping mechanism for living in the post-apocalyptic present, not least of all because these poems emphasize the porosity and toxicity of the world we inhabit. The BP Deepwater Horizon spill looms large in the background, an image of oil contaminating the ocean, but also the economy and our (inter)personal relationships. However, I think the collection emphasizes toxicity not necessarily as a bad thing, something to be avoided, but rather situates toxicity and contamination as immanent with and to how we move through the world. The collection\u2019s second poem, \u2018Brent Crude,\u2019 interweaves the price of oil into the speaker\u2019s participation in marches and rallies, their life as a parent, and their profession as a poet. The Brent Crude Oil Spot price contaminates the speaker\u2019s life, appearing repeatedly throughout the poem. The speaker insists, \u2018I am trying to figure something out. Something I do not yet understand about my physical body, my real financial, medical, and social needs\u2019 (23). Embodiment is not self-sufficient, but exceedingly dependent on the institutions and systems we find ourselves imbricated with(in). The poem foregrounds this, modeling less how we come to terms with this existence, than showing how we might identify where embodiment exceeds our grasp, or where our autonomy becomes wound up in something other than ourselves. A physical body is not just matter, but an intra-active mattering with a complex matrix of discursive and material apparatuses\u2014\u2018financial, medical, and social,\u2019 but also ecological and ontological. The poem\u2019s final stanza moves us to identify the complexity of the dynamic we inhabit, with someone telling the speaker, \u2018the last thing we need is another BP poem; someone said just another nature poem\u2026Not to me necessarily. At other moments to me but that doesn\u2019t matter. It was in the air\u2019 (25). \u2018Brent Crude\u2019 moves from nature or the oil spill as such to nature and oil as bound up in our own lives; from contamination to the way contamination functions. Privileging autonomy belies a shared corporeal vulnerability with both humans and nonhumans with(in) the intra-active reality we co(in)habit. It denies the dynamism inherent in our relationship with the world, and pretends that nature is somehow limitless and self-producing resource that we must merely manage (though Trump seems uninterested in even doing that ). What is to be done? We are all in this together. And though \u2018we\u2019 are perhaps differently situated in whatever \u2018this\u2019 is, we must leverage the double valence of our (im)potentiality in an effort to re-imagine or re-theorize the present and future. \u2018Brent Crude\u2019 might be a helpful companion in this task. The collection, for me, foregrounds the impossibility of autonomy, on the one hand, and the necessity of foregoing fantasies of autonomy, on the other, in order to sustain anything like a future. In Spahr, this involves moving from a nature poetry that posits a nature somewhere over there that we can observe and write about, to a nature that we\u2019re active participants. In That Winter the Wolf Came this isn\u2019t a choice or an imperative, but a reality that we\u2019re called to recognize or risk annihilation in a self-same and post-apocalyptic present. I think we\u2019re seeing this shift in contemporary U.S. politics to an extent\u2014a realization that politics isn\u2019t something that happens over there, on election day(s), but a space that we actively co-produce on a daily basis. This is, of course, met with backlash by the current administration that prefers a univocal deployment of political force. But I think there\u2019s an increasing number of models of rethinking this kind of engagement, which might transmute into a shift in how we engage with(in) the environment we cohabit. Spahr\u2019s poetry here and beyond is a useful resource for finding the intersections and intra-activities among human and nonhuman in precarious times.", "title": "[006 - That Winter the Wolf Came, autonomy, and climate] - inadequate futures"}, {"loc": "/classes/", "tags": "nonetags", "text": "engl 288: nature in literature - human @ the limit [spring 2017] At the intersection of discussions about intensified global warming, diminishing populations of endangered species, and increasingly perceptive artificial intelligence stands the human, or, at least, the question of the human. In mapping these territories, we necessarily come up against the human and its connection to animals, nature, culture, and technology. While this course focuses on the relationship of human beings and the environment in which they function, as represented in a variety of literary works (the university course description), we will also attend to questions about how we understand and constitute both \u201chuman beings\u201d and \u201cenvironment\u201d: How \u201cnatural\u201d is nature and how is it similar or different from \u201cculture\u201d? What is our relationship to animals, plants, machines, and nature, and what kind of responsibility do these relationships entail?

Vimeo, Soundcloud, Tumblr. The way we access and consume both media and narratives has changed radically over the past decade and a half. With this transformation comes a shift in how narratives are formed and disseminated\u2014television shows begin to look like novels while novels begin to resemble websites; entire seasons of television are released in a single day; Vimeo, YouTube, and iTunes become essential spaces for long form journalism and serialized narratives. These shifts prompt some questions: how exactly do these narratives differ (in form and content) from those 20, 30, or 40 years ago? How has technology, like the Internet or eReaders, changed the novel or how we read? How have televisual narratives adapted to streaming providers like Netflix or Amazon? Following Fredrich Kittler\u2019s claim that \u201cmedia determine our situation,\u201d this class will examine two (among other) interwoven questions: How has narrative, especially the novel and television, adapted and responded to contemporary technologies, and how has our experience and consumption of these narratives changed as a result?

This foundational course in literary studies explores metafictional literature in a variety of modes and genres, including prose, poetry, drama, and film. Surveying literature from the late 19th century to the present, we will investigate texts that exceed their own fictional world or call attention to their own textual status.

Borrowing the term from Wai Chee Dimock\u2019s \u2018A Theory of Resonance,\u2019 I utilize the notion of resonance to emphasize that knowledge is not an object unilaterally disseminated by experts, but an unstable result of our relation to texts both fleshy and pulpy. What we learn emerges from the act of reading, participating in discussion, and in the process of composition. Critical thinking and close reading are vital aspects of what literary studies offers students, but I underscore how these methodologies are tools for navigating the world, not just texts in a classroom. Because the classes I teach often center contemporary literature, film, television, and pop culture, close reading becomes an indispensable strategy for working with texts that lack a wide breadth of critical commentary. However, close reading is also something we\u2019re compelled to practice everyday. Recognizing how the everyday texts we encounter shape us as much as we shape them is vital for living in the media saturated present. Honing close reading and critical thinking skills encourages students to be reflective participants in the ongoing (re)production of the world we co(in)habit. Towards this end, my classroom privileges student discussion and participation. Classrooms are not only comprised of students, instructors, and texts, but also an array of disparate affects, concepts, and objects. Understanding \u2018collaboration\u2019 as very literally laboring with and within these constraints demonstrates the indistinction between the classroom and what lies beyond its walls. In this way, class discussions are always in the service of how texts work and how they ask us to see the world differently. By encouraging students to consider what a text does rather than what it means, I reorient habituated modes of learning towards a process model that privileges methodology over content. This also facilitates less restrictive class discussion in which students offer various accounts of how texts function or resonate rather than relying on me to explain what they mean. By decentering the source of and process by which we produce knowledge, I ask students to consider themselves as indispensable nodal points for circulating and transforming ideas. My emphasis on the function and force of language is echoed in my composition pedagogy. When close reading is positioned as a vital skill for navigating the world, students become attuned to how language works and interweave their reading practices into their compositional practices. While we read and discuss various models for what \u2018good\u2019 writing does, I underscore writing as a process by which we take aim at an idea. Writing is always unfinished\u2014even final drafts must be read as in-progress.
